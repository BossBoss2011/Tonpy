# Tonpy
Learned algorithms but not programming languages? This programming language is structured similarly to an algorithm.
## What is Tonpy?
Tonpy is a programming language made in python (also includes all python features) which is made to be more child-friendly and easier to learn, with some easy-to-understand terms such as `number()` instead of `int()`.
## How do I use Tonpy?
To answer that question, we suggest you check [The Documentation](https://github.com/BossBoss2011/Tonpy/wiki/Documentation).
